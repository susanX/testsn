Interview With Snact
POSTED ON JAN 3, 2017 BY LA

Can you believe we throw away 7 million tonnes of food and drink from our homes every year in the UK alone? Worldwide, we throw away more than 1/3 of all the food that we grow. And most of this could have been eaten. 
Food waste is a big problem. But luckily, food waste heroes do exist, and they’re saving the planet one apple at a time! 
Enter Ilana Taub from healthy snack brand, Snact. Snact make snacks from surplus fruit; fruit that would have otherwise been thrown away for being too ugly, too small, too big or too abundant. It’s naturally vegan and gluten-free and, more importantly, it’s really tasty!
Ilana was kind enough to send me a few packs when I asked to interview her. The apple, blueberry and banana jerky has my vote!
So, Ilana, what inspired you to start making fruit jerky from food waste?
Michael (Snact’s other co-founder) and I both have an environmental/business and sustainability background and we are both passionate about the food system. Three years ago, we came together with the idea of starting a business together. We thought food waste was something that needed to be tackled and so started looking for ideas… We realised apples were one of the most wasted fruit in the UK and we started from there. 
So, what’s next? What have you got planned for the future of Snact?
We’re hoping to launch some new product ranges next year and to keep growing so we can keep having a bigger and bigger impact!
Great! I’m looking forward to seeing your new stuff. Where can people buy your products?
You can find us in As Nature Intended, Planet Organic, Sourced Market, online at Ocado, in lots of independents shops & cafes and through our own shop.

Finally, if you were a fruit, what would you be and why?
Funnily enough I was asked this question long before I started Snact. My answer at the time was pomegranate but I’ll keep it a mystery as to why!
